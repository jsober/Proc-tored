=head1 NAME

Proc::tored - Service management using a pid file and touch files

=head1 VERSION

version 0.08

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Proc::tored;

  my $service = service 'stuff-doer', in '/var/run';

  # Run service
  run { do_stuff() or stop $service } $service
    or die 'existing process running under pid '
          . running $service;

  # Terminate another running process, timing out after 15s
  zap $service, 15
    or die 'stuff_doer pid ' . running $service . ' is being stubborn';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Proc::tored> service is voluntarily managed by a pid file and touch files.

=head1 EXPORTED SUBROUTINES

C<Proc::tored> is an C<Exporter>. All routines are exported by default.

=head2 service

Defines the service by name. The pid file will be created as C<name.pid>.

  my $service = service 'thing', ...;

=head2 in

Sets the directory where the pid file will be created.

  my $service = service 'thing', in '/var/run';

=head2 run

Starts the service loop, calling the supplied code block until it either
returns false or the service is stopped (internally via L</stop> or externally
via L</zap>).

  run {
    my $task = get_next_task() or return;
    process_task($task);
    return 1;
  } $service;

=head2 stop

Tells the L</run> loop to shut down.

  run {
    my $task = get_next_task() or stop $service;
    process_task($task);
    return 1;
  } $service;

=head2 hold

While "on hold", the L</run> loop will pause, not executing the code ref until
L</resume> is called.

=head2 resume

Ends the "on hold" condition, causing the loop to resume execution of the code
ref.

=head1 SERVICE CONTROL

These functions control another running process.

=head2 running

If the supplied service is running as another process (as found in the pid
file), returns the pid of that process. Returns 0 otherwise.

  zap $service if running $service;

=head2 zap

Signals a running instance of the service that it should self-terminate
(assuming it is also C<Proc::tored>). Accepts an optional C<$timeout> in
fractional seconds, causing C<zap> to wait up to C<$timeout> seconds for the
process to exit.

  zap $service, 30
    or die 'timed out after 30s waiting for service to exit';

=head2 pause

Creates a touch file that signals a running instance to pause.

=head2 unpause

Clears the touch file used to pause a running instance.
