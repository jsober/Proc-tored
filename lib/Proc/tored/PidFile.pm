# ABSTRACT: Manage a service using a pid file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Proc::tored::PidFile;

  my $pidfile = Proc::tored::PidFile->new(file_path => $pid_file_path);

  if (my $lock = $pidfile->lock) {
    run_service;
  }

    die "service is already running under process id "
      . $pidfile->running_pid;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 METHODS

=head2 is_running

Returns true if the pid indicated by the pid file is the current process.

=cut

sub is_running {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->running_pid == $$;
}

=head2 running_pid

Returns true if the pid indicated by the pid file is an active, running
process. This is determined by attempting to signal the process using C<kill(0,
$pid)>.

=cut

sub running_pid {
  my $self = shift;
  my $pid = $self->read_file;
  return 0 unless $pid;
  return $pid if kill 0, $pid;
  return 0;
}

=head2 read_file

Returns the pid stored in the pid file or 0 if the pid file does not exist or
is empty.

=cut

sub read_file {
  my $self = shift;
  return 0 unless $self->file->is_file;
  my ($line) = $self->file->lines({count => 1, chomp => 1}) or return 0;
  my ($pid) = $line =~ /^(\d+)$/;
  return $pid || 0;
}

=head2 write_file

Writes the current process id to the pid file. Returns true on success, false
if the pid file exists and contains a running process id or if unable to
atomically write the pid file out.

=cut

sub write_file {
  my $self = shift;
  my $lock = $self->write_lock or return 0;
  return 0 if $self->running_pid;
  $self->file->spew("$$\n");
  return 1;
}

=head2 clear_file

Truncates the pid file and then unlinks it.

=cut

sub clear_file {
  my $self = shift;
  my $lock = $self->write_lock or return;
  return unless $self->is_running;
  $self->file->append({truncate => 1});
  try { $self->file->remove }
  catch { warn "error unlinking pid file: $_" }
}

=head2 lock

Attempts to write the current process id to the pid file and returns a L<Guard>
that will truncate and unlink the pid file if it goes out of scope.

  {
    my $lock = $pidfile->lock;
    run_service;
  }

  # $lock goes out of scope and pid file is truncated and unlinked

=cut

sub lock {
  my $self = shift;
  return guard { $self->clear_file } if $self->write_file;
  return;
}

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Creates a .lock file based on $self->pid_file. While the file exists, the
# lock is considered to be held. Returns a Guard that removes the file.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sub write_lock {
  my $self = shift;
  return unless $$ eq $self->mypid;

  # Existing .lock file means another process came in ahead
  my $lock = $self->write_lock_file;
  return if $lock->exists;

  my $locked = try {
      $lock->filehandle({exclusive => 1}, '>');
    }
    catch {
      # Rethrow if error was something other than the file already existing.
      # Assume any 'sysopen' error matching 'File exists' is an indication
      # of that.
      die $_
        unless $_->{op} eq 'sysopen' && $_->{err} =~ /File exists/i
            || $lock->exists;
    };

  return unless $locked;

  return guard {
    try { $lock->remove }
    catch { carp "unable to remove lock file: $_" }
  };
}
